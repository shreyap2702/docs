# Autosend Python SDK

This SDK provides a simple Python SDK for the AutoSend Email API.
It removes the need to manually build HTTP requests, manage payloads, or handle API endpoints.

If you want to send transactional emails, bulk messages, or manage contacts from Python, this SDK provides a clean and consistent way to do it.

The package is published on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/autosend-shreya-sdk/ (install with `pip install autosend-shreya-sdk`).

Note: this is a community-maintained (unofficial) package and is not an official AutoSend release.
